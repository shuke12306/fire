# Bootstrap HTML、可选外部资产与调用顺序

This document covers protocol-adjacent surfaces that are useful for reproducing a LinuxDo client but are not ordinary Discourse JSON endpoints.

## 1. Discourse Bootstrap HTML

```http
GET https://linux.do/
Accept: text/html
```

The Discourse HTML shell contains metadata and preloaded JSON that can avoid several startup requests.

### Extracted Metadata

| Data | Source | Use |
|---|---|---|
| CSRF token | `<meta name="csrf-token" content="...">` | `X-CSRF-Token` for mutating requests |
| Shared session key | `<meta name="shared_session_key" content="...">` | `X-Shared-Session-Key` for cross-origin MessageBus polling |
| Turnstile sitekey | `data-sitekey="..."` | Cloudflare challenge page integration |
| Base URI | `<meta name="discourse-base-uri" content="...">` | Sub-path deployment prefix |
| CDN URLs | `#data-discourse-setup` attributes such as `data-cdn`, `data-s3-cdn`, `data-s3-base-url` | Static assets and upload URL resolution |
| Preloaded JSON | `data-preloaded="..."` | Startup data blocks |

HTML attribute values can contain HTML entities. Decode entities before parsing embedded JSON.

### Preloaded Data Blocks

Common blocks:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `currentUser` | Current authenticated user, when cookies are valid |
| `siteSettings` | Site settings, plugin flags, composer limits, `long_polling_base_url` |
| `site` | Categories, top tags, `can_tag_topics`, `post_action_types`, group/flair metadata |
| `topicList` / `topic_list` / `latest` | Initial topic list; deployments can vary key names |
| `topicTrackingStateMeta` | MessageBus channel initial ids for topic tracking |
| `topicTrackingStates` | Existing per-topic tracking state |
| `customEmoji` | Custom emoji metadata |
| `enabledReactions` or site-setting derived reactions | Available reaction names |

Important `siteSettings` fields for composers and feature gates include:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `min_topic_title_length` | Minimum topic title length |
| `min_personal_message_title_length` | Minimum private-message title length |
| `min_post_length` | Minimum reply length |
| `min_first_post_length` | Minimum first-post length |
| `min_personal_message_post_length` | Minimum private-message body length |
| `discourse_reactions_enabled_reactions` | Pipe-separated enabled reaction names |
| `long_polling_base_url` | Optional alternate MessageBus polling origin |
| `secure_uploads` | Whether upload short links should remain protected |

## 2. Optional Sticker Market Assets

Sticker market data is an optional static JSON integration. The base URL is product-configurable; do not hard-code it into the LinuxDo protocol layer.

Observed path shape:

```http
GET {sticker_market_base_url}/assets/market/index/index.json
GET {sticker_market_base_url}/assets/market/index/page-{page}.json
GET {sticker_market_base_url}/assets/market/group-{group_id}.json
```

Clients should cache these static JSON responses and may use stale cache data if the asset host is unavailable. Cache storage and expiration policy are implementation choices.

## 3. Recommended Startup Order

1. Restore cookies for `https://linux.do`.
2. `GET /` and parse bootstrap metadata/preloaded data.
3. If bootstrap contains `currentUser`, treat it as an authenticated user hint.
4. If cookies exist but bootstrap has no `currentUser`, validate with `GET /session/current.json`.
5. Load `GET /site.json` only for missing category/tag/composer metadata.
6. Configure MessageBus with `long_polling_base_url` and `shared_session_key` if present.
7. Subscribe to advertised topic-tracking channels and any active user/topic channels.

## 4. Recommended Login Order

1. Open the official Discourse login flow in a browser-capable context.
2. Complete password/OAuth/PassKey/hCaptcha/Cloudflare interactions in that context.
3. Copy resulting cookies for `https://linux.do` into the HTTP client cookie store.
4. Fetch bootstrap HTML or call `GET /session/current.json` to confirm identity.
5. Fetch CSRF if no token was discovered in bootstrap HTML.
6. Start MessageBus subscriptions after the user id and channel metadata are known.

## 5. Recommended Topic Detail Order

1. `GET /t/{topic_id}.json` or `GET /t/{topic_id}/{post_number}.json`.
2. Read `post_stream.stream` and keep the topic metadata from the detail payload.
3. Fetch missing post payloads with `GET /t/{topic_id}/posts.json?post_ids[]=...`.
4. Start sidecar capabilities as needed: `POST /topics/timings`, `GET /presence/get`, `POST /presence/update`, AI summary, reactions, polls, and topic MessageBus subscriptions.

## 6. Recommended Publish Order

1. Optionally save a draft with `POST /drafts.json`.
2. Upload files with `POST /uploads.json`.
3. Validate mentions with `GET /composer/mentions` when needed.
4. Create a topic, reply, or private message with `POST /posts.json`.
5. Remove the consumed draft with `DELETE /drafts/{draft_key}.json`.

## 7. Out-Of-Scope App Services

App update checks, release feeds, telemetry, crash reporting, product-specific CDNs, and local cache storage formats are application infrastructure. They should not be documented as LinuxDo backend protocol unless the service is part of LinuxDo itself.
