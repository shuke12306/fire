# Fire Performance Benchmarks

These benchmark definitions are release gates. Current scripts provide repeatable measurement workflows, but final baselines must be recorded on real release builds before submission.

## Targets

| Metric | Target | Failure Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cold start to home visible | < 3.0s | > 5.0s |
| Home feed scroll fluency | >= 58 fps average | < 55 fps average or > 5% janky frames |
| Topic detail first screen | < 2.0s | > 3.0s |
| Home feed memory | < 200 MB | > 300 MB |
| Topic detail memory after 100 posts | < 350 MB | > 500 MB |

## Required Devices

| Platform | Preferred Device | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | Current physical iPhone Pro device | iPhone simulator for smoke runs only |
| Android | Pixel 8-class physical device | Pixel emulator for smoke runs only |

## Scripts

```bash
scripts/benchmark-cold-start.sh ios
scripts/benchmark-cold-start.sh android
scripts/benchmark-scroll-fps.sh ios
scripts/benchmark-scroll-fps.sh android
scripts/benchmark-topic-load.sh ios
scripts/benchmark-topic-load.sh android
scripts/benchmark-memory-peak.sh ios
scripts/benchmark-memory-peak.sh android
```

## Results Log

| Date | Commit | Platform | Device | Build Type | Metric | Result | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | | | | |

Use exactly the metric names from the target table. `Pass/Fail` accepts `Pass`
for measurements inside the release threshold or `Accepted` for an explicit
ship/no-ship decision on a threshold failure. Simulator and emulator rows may be
linked as supporting context elsewhere, but they do not satisfy this log.

## Release Rule

Do not mark P4 performance complete until this log contains release-build measurements for iOS and Android, and any failures have an explicit owner or ship/no-ship decision.

Before marking performance evidence complete, run:

```bash
scripts/verify-performance-benchmarks.sh
```

The verifier fails until each target metric has an iOS and Android
release-build physical-device row with date, commit, device, result, and
`Pass` or `Accepted` disposition.
