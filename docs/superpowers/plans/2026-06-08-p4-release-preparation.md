# Prepare Fire Release Materials

> **For agentic workers:** Use this plan as the P4 release-preparation source of truth. Checkbox state tracks repository artifacts only; store-console actions, real screenshots/videos, legal review, device benchmarks, and accessibility audits remain manual gates.

## Feasibility Assessment

P4 is process-heavy and does not require changes to the Rust/native architecture. The repository can hold listing drafts, privacy/data-safety drafts, benchmark scripts, accessibility checklists, license inventories, and marketing asset folders now. Final App Store / Play Store readiness still requires human store access and real-device validation. Feasible with caveats: repository scaffolding is complete, but release acceptance remains blocked on manual evidence.

## Current Surface Inventory

- `docs/release/` -- release copy, compliance drafts, testing guides, benchmark definitions, accessibility checklist, release-gate evidence register, and license inventory.
- `native/ios-app/marketing/` -- App Store screenshot and preview-video folder structure.
- `native/android-app/marketing/` -- Play Store screenshot and feature-graphic folder structure.
- `scripts/ios/archive_release.sh` -- existing iOS archive/upload path used by the TestFlight guide.
- `scripts/ios/verify_xcode26_toolchain.sh` -- existing App Store Connect toolchain guard used before iOS uploads.
- `scripts/collect-licenses.sh` -- generated third-party dependency inventory.
- `scripts/verify-marketing-assets.sh` -- store marketing asset verifier for final screenshots, optional App Preview file placement, and Play feature-graphic dimensions.
- `scripts/verify-performance-benchmarks.sh` -- release benchmark evidence verifier for physical-device iOS and Android result rows.
- `scripts/verify-accessibility-audit.sh` -- release accessibility evidence verifier for physical-device iOS and Android screen/audit rows.

- `scripts/verify-privacy-review-evidence.sh` -- maintainer/legal privacy review evidence verifier.
- `scripts/verify-release-readiness.sh` -- composite P4 release-readiness verifier that runs every release guard.
- `scripts/verify-release-gates.sh` -- release-gate evidence verifier for the exact required manual gate set.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-plan-contract.sh` -- roadmap document contract verifier for the one-spec/four-plan task counts.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-architecture-constraints.sh` -- roadmap architecture/platform-boundary verifier for minimum APIs, native runtime paths, and reference boundaries.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-implementation-evidence.sh` -- checked P1-P3 roadmap implementation evidence verifier.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-p4-acceptance.sh` -- roadmap P4 acceptance verifier that keeps checked boxes tied to release-gate evidence.
- `scripts/benchmark-*.sh` -- benchmark workflows for cold start, scroll fluency, topic load, and memory.
- `native/android-app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` -- Android backup is release-disabled with `allowBackup="false"`.
- `native/android-app/src/main/res/xml/backup_rules.xml` -- all-exclude Android Auto Backup rules.
- `native/android-app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml` -- all-exclude Android cloud-backup and device-transfer rules.
- `native/ios-app/Configs/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` -- app privacy manifest with required-reason API declarations.
- `native/ios-app/Configs/FireWidget/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` -- widget extension privacy manifest with required-reason API declarations.
- `native/ios-app/Sources/FireAppSession/APM/FireAPMManager.swift` -- local PLCrashReporter / MetricKit diagnostic behavior.
- `native/ios-app/App/DeveloperTools/FirePushDiagnosticsView.swift` -- APNs token is local-only at this stage.
- `native/android-app/src/main/java/com/fire/app/push/FireFirebaseMessagingService.kt` -- FCM token registration API is not available; payloads are local notification input.
- `rust/crates/fire-core/tests/session_flow.rs` -- verifies that redacted session export strips auth cookies while preserving bootstrap context.

## Design

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Version release source material, not fake final media.** The repo now includes marketing directories and `.gitkeep` placeholders, but no fabricated screenshots, preview videos, or feature graphics. Real assets must come from release-candidate builds.
2. **Keep privacy drafts conservative.** Privacy documents state local diagnostics, widget snapshots, offline cache, local push token handling, Android backup exclusion, privacy-manifest coverage, and redacted-export behavior without overclaiming legal review.
3. **Make benchmark scripts honest about prerequisites.** Android scripts use `adb` when available; iOS scripts print required Instruments/xctrace workflows because reliable iOS FPS/memory/topic measurements require device tooling.
4. **Generate license inventory from current declarations.** `scripts/collect-licenses.sh` uses `cargo metadata --locked` for Rust crate license fields and resolves Android `releaseRuntimeClasspath` with Gradle before reading Maven POM license metadata. Full legal review and Swift package license-text review remain required.
5. **Separate repository completion from release acceptance.** P4 acceptance boxes in the roadmap remain unchecked until real store/test/performance/accessibility evidence exists.
6. **Keep manual gate evidence centralized.** `docs/release/release-gate-evidence.md` is the register for screenshots, store records, legal signoff, release-build benchmarks, accessibility audit runs, and any accepted waivers. It does not satisfy those gates by itself.
7. **Make the final release gate fail closed.** `scripts/verify-release-gates.sh` checks the evidence register and fails until the exact required gate rows are present once, with no unknown rows, and every row has an accepted/completed status, owner, evidence link, and date. Manual evidence verifiers reject completed rows that still contain fake/mock/placeholder-style evidence markers. Current failure is expected because manual gates are still open.
8. **Make store-media structure checkable before evidence closure.** `scripts/verify-marketing-assets.sh` validates that required screenshot buckets contain real PNG/JPEG files with readable dimensions, final asset filenames do not carry fake/mock/placeholder-style markers, screenshots are at least 320px on each side, the optional App Preview path is unambiguous and contains MP4 `ftyp` content when present, and the Play feature graphic is PNG content with exact `1024x500` dimensions. The script is expected to fail until final release-candidate media exists.
9. **Make benchmark evidence complete by metric and platform.** `scripts/verify-performance-benchmarks.sh` checks `performance-benchmarks.md` for iOS and Android release-build physical-device rows for every target metric, and fails until threshold failures are fixed or explicitly accepted with notes.
10. **Make accessibility evidence complete by screen and audit area.** `scripts/verify-accessibility-audit.sh` checks `accessibility-audit-checklist.md` for iOS and Android physical-device rows covering every listed screen and audit category, and fails until blocking failures are fixed or explicitly accepted with notes.
11. **Make testing-track evidence explicit.** `docs/release/internal-testing-evidence.md` records App Store Connect / Play Console records, release-candidate uploads, tester invites, and feedback triage. `scripts/verify-internal-testing-evidence.sh` fails until all required platform rows are complete.
12. **Make privacy review evidence explicit.** `docs/release/privacy-review-evidence.md` records maintainer/legal review of the privacy policy, store answers, backup behavior, diagnostic redaction, privacy manifests, license inventory, and final publication approval. `scripts/verify-privacy-review-evidence.sh` fails until all required review rows are complete.
13. **Make final readiness one command.** `scripts/verify-release-readiness.sh` runs the marketing, performance, accessibility, internal-testing, privacy-review, evidence-register, roadmap plan contract, roadmap architecture constraints, roadmap implementation evidence, and roadmap P4 acceptance verifiers together. It does not replace any underlying gate; it fails until every lower-level verifier passes.
14. **Keep the roadmap document contract checkable.** `scripts/verify-roadmap-plan-contract.sh` verifies the one design spec and four implementation plans stay present with P1/P2/P3/P4 top-level task counts of 17/14/15/6.
15. **Keep architecture constraints evidence-bound.** `scripts/verify-roadmap-architecture-constraints.sh` checks the platform/Rust ownership split, minimum API targets, iOS topic-detail native runtime path, and reference/infrastructure repository boundaries.
16. **Keep checked implementation acceptance evidence-bound.** `scripts/verify-roadmap-implementation-evidence.sh` checks concrete code files, symbols, scoped cleanup patterns, and size limits that support the checked P1-P3 acceptance rows.
17. **Keep roadmap P4 acceptance evidence-bound.** `scripts/verify-roadmap-p4-acceptance.sh` checks the exact P4 acceptance rows in the design document and fails if any box is checked before the release-gate evidence verifier passes.

## Architectural Notes

- No Rust/native architecture changes are part of P4 release-prep scaffolding.
- The platform/Rust ownership split remains unchanged.
- `references/fluxdo/` and `third_party/` are not edited by this plan.
- Generated release media is intentionally absent until captured from real release-candidate builds.
- Privacy and data-safety drafts are conservative working documents, not final legal text.
- `docs/release/release-gate-evidence.md` tracks manual gate proof, but rows start as `Not started` and must be updated by the humans or release engineers who perform those actions.
- `scripts/verify-marketing-assets.sh` is expected to fail while marketing folders contain only `.gitkeep` placeholders, while final asset filenames still contain fake/mock/placeholder-style markers, or while screenshot/feature-graphic dimensions do not match the release constraints; it is a precondition for store-media evidence closure, not a replacement for human asset review.
- `scripts/verify-performance-benchmarks.sh` is expected to fail while benchmark results are absent; it is a precondition for performance evidence closure, not a substitute for release-build physical-device measurement.
- `scripts/verify-accessibility-audit.sh` is expected to fail while accessibility results are absent; it is a precondition for accessibility evidence closure, not a substitute for a release-candidate assistive-technology audit.
- `scripts/verify-internal-testing-evidence.sh` is expected to fail while store records, uploaded builds, tester invites, or feedback triage rows are absent; it is a precondition for internal-testing evidence closure, not a substitute for store-console access.
- `scripts/verify-privacy-review-evidence.sh` is expected to fail while maintainer/legal review evidence is absent; it is a precondition for privacy evidence closure, not a substitute for legal approval.
- `scripts/verify-release-readiness.sh` is expected to fail while any lower-level P4 verifier fails; it is the final repo-owned readiness command before changing roadmap P4 acceptance.
- `scripts/verify-release-gates.sh` is expected to fail until the manual P4 evidence rows are populated, and it also fails if required gate rows are renamed, duplicated, missing, or unknown; this is a release guard, not a development-test failure.
- Manual evidence verifiers are expected to fail if completed evidence rows still contain fake, mock, placeholder, dummy, synthetic, TODO/TBD, `example.com`, `not-real`, or `not real` markers.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-plan-contract.sh` is expected to pass while the roadmap document set keeps one spec, four implementation plans, and the agreed 17/14/15/6 top-level task split.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-architecture-constraints.sh` is expected to pass while the platform/Rust ownership split, minimum API targets, iOS topic-detail native runtime path, and reference/infrastructure boundaries stay intact.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-implementation-evidence.sh` is expected to pass while checked P1-P3 acceptance code paths remain present; it does not prove P4 release readiness.
- `scripts/verify-roadmap-p4-acceptance.sh` is expected to pass while P4 roadmap acceptance remains unchecked, and to fail if any acceptance box is checked before release-gate evidence passes.
- Roadmap P4 acceptance remains unchecked until manual evidence exists.
