# Prepare Fire Release Materials

> **For agentic workers:** Use this plan as the P4 release-preparation source of truth. Checkbox state tracks repository artifacts only; store-console actions, real screenshots/videos, legal review, device benchmarks, and accessibility audits remain manual gates.

## Feasibility Assessment

P4 is process-heavy and does not require changes to the Rust/native architecture. The repository can hold listing drafts, privacy/data-safety drafts, benchmark scripts, accessibility checklists, license inventories, and marketing asset folders now. Final App Store / Play Store readiness still requires human store access and real-device validation. Feasible with caveats: repository scaffolding is complete, but release acceptance remains blocked on manual evidence.

## Current Surface Inventory

- `docs/release/` -- release copy, compliance drafts, testing guides, benchmark definitions, accessibility checklist, release-gate evidence register, and license inventory.
- `native/ios-app/marketing/` -- App Store screenshot and preview-video folder structure.
- `native/android-app/marketing/` -- Play Store screenshot and feature-graphic folder structure.
- `scripts/ios/archive_release.sh` -- existing iOS archive/upload path used by the TestFlight guide.
- `scripts/ios/verify_xcode26_toolchain.sh` -- existing App Store Connect toolchain guard used before iOS uploads.
- `scripts/collect-licenses.sh` -- generated third-party dependency inventory.
- `scripts/verify-marketing-assets.sh` -- store marketing asset verifier for final screenshots, optional App Preview file placement, and Play feature-graphic dimensions.
- `scripts/verify-performance-benchmarks.sh` -- release benchmark evidence verifier for physical-device iOS and Android result rows.
- `scripts/verify-release-gates.sh` -- release-gate evidence verifier.
- `scripts/benchmark-*.sh` -- benchmark workflows for cold start, scroll fluency, topic load, and memory.
- `native/android-app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` -- Android backup is release-disabled with `allowBackup="false"`.
- `native/android-app/src/main/res/xml/backup_rules.xml` -- all-exclude Android Auto Backup rules.
- `native/android-app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml` -- all-exclude Android cloud-backup and device-transfer rules.
- `native/ios-app/Configs/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` -- app privacy manifest with required-reason API declarations.
- `native/ios-app/Configs/FireWidget/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` -- widget extension privacy manifest with required-reason API declarations.
- `native/ios-app/Sources/FireAppSession/APM/FireAPMManager.swift` -- local PLCrashReporter / MetricKit diagnostic behavior.
- `native/ios-app/App/DeveloperTools/FirePushDiagnosticsView.swift` -- APNs token is local-only at this stage.
- `native/android-app/src/main/java/com/fire/app/push/FireFirebaseMessagingService.kt` -- FCM token registration API is not available; payloads are local notification input.
- `rust/crates/fire-core/tests/session_flow.rs` -- verifies that redacted session export strips auth cookies while preserving bootstrap context.

## Design

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Version release source material, not fake final media.** The repo now includes marketing directories and `.gitkeep` placeholders, but no fabricated screenshots, preview videos, or feature graphics. Real assets must come from release-candidate builds.
2. **Keep privacy drafts conservative.** Privacy documents state local diagnostics, widget snapshots, offline cache, local push token handling, Android backup exclusion, privacy-manifest coverage, and redacted-export behavior without overclaiming legal review.
3. **Make benchmark scripts honest about prerequisites.** Android scripts use `adb` when available; iOS scripts print required Instruments/xctrace workflows because reliable iOS FPS/memory/topic measurements require device tooling.
4. **Generate license inventory from current declarations.** `scripts/collect-licenses.sh` uses `cargo metadata --locked` for Rust crate license fields and resolves Android `releaseRuntimeClasspath` with Gradle before reading Maven POM license metadata. Full legal review and Swift package license-text review remain required.
5. **Separate repository completion from release acceptance.** P4 acceptance boxes in the roadmap remain unchecked until real store/test/performance/accessibility evidence exists.
6. **Keep manual gate evidence centralized.** `docs/release/release-gate-evidence.md` is the register for screenshots, store records, legal signoff, release-build benchmarks, accessibility audit runs, and any accepted waivers. It does not satisfy those gates by itself.
7. **Make the final release gate fail closed.** `scripts/verify-release-gates.sh` checks the evidence register and fails until every row has an accepted/completed status, owner, evidence link, and date. Current failure is expected because manual gates are still open.
8. **Make store-media structure checkable before evidence closure.** `scripts/verify-marketing-assets.sh` validates that required screenshot buckets contain real PNG/JPEG files with readable dimensions, the optional App Preview path is unambiguous, and the Play feature graphic is PNG content with exact `1024x500` dimensions. The script is expected to fail until final release-candidate media exists.
9. **Make benchmark evidence complete by metric and platform.** `scripts/verify-performance-benchmarks.sh` checks `performance-benchmarks.md` for iOS and Android release-build physical-device rows for every target metric, and fails until threshold failures are fixed or explicitly accepted with notes.

## Architectural Notes

- No Rust/native architecture changes are part of P4 release-prep scaffolding.
- The platform/Rust ownership split remains unchanged.
- `references/fluxdo/` and `third_party/` are not edited by this plan.
- Generated release media is intentionally absent until captured from real release-candidate builds.
- Privacy and data-safety drafts are conservative working documents, not final legal text.
- `docs/release/release-gate-evidence.md` tracks manual gate proof, but rows start as `Not started` and must be updated by the humans or release engineers who perform those actions.
- `scripts/verify-marketing-assets.sh` is expected to fail while marketing folders contain only `.gitkeep` placeholders; it is a precondition for store-media evidence closure, not a replacement for human asset review.
- `scripts/verify-performance-benchmarks.sh` is expected to fail while benchmark results are absent; it is a precondition for performance evidence closure, not a substitute for release-build physical-device measurement.
- `scripts/verify-release-gates.sh` is expected to fail until the manual P4 evidence rows are populated; this is a release guard, not a development-test failure.
- Roadmap P4 acceptance remains unchecked until manual evidence exists.
